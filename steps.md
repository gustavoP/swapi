# Thinking Steps

## Check API [documentation](https://swapi.co/)
* There is a integration with python already [implemented](https://github.com/phalt/swapi-python), but it's intended to direct call the API.

## Creating gitHub project
* Creating a gitHub repository, and first commit

## Creating Env 
* Creating a conda environment

## Implement
* The idea is to be easy for the user(developer) to understand
* One module was created to encapsulate the api root, because is easy to change.
* One class for the 'people' api, to retrieve this data. From all people are verified their vehicles and checked the speed.

## CLI
* Searching for a library to improve the style. 
* Using [PyInquirer](https://github.com/CITGuru/PyInquirer)

## ToDo
* It's would be good if a cache system was implemented.
