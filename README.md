# SWAPI
The steps of the development are in 'steps.md'

This is a simple aplication to retrieve the top pilots in the Start Wars universe using the [SWAPI API](https://swapi.co/).

## Code execution
I sugest creating a environment, with conda or pip:

.. code:: shell
    python3 -m venv env

And than install the requirements

.. code:: shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Finnaly run

.. code:: shell
    python main.py
