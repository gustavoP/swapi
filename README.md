# SWAPI
The steps of the development are found [here](steps.md)

This is a simple aplication to retrieve the top pilots in the Start Wars universe using the [SWAPI API](https://swapi.co/).

## Code execution
I sugest creating a environment, with conda or pip:

`python3 -m venv env`

And than install the requirements

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Finnaly, run.

`python main.py`
